## Caster
### Base
<img src="Media/base.png" width="800">
This is a base I made for a caster in onshape. This assignment was meant to be an introduction to onshape, and to just help us grasp how to use it and how onshape is similar to solidworks. For the base, I made a rectangle, and then add seven holes to it. The first hole is bigger and it is centered around the origin, while the other six are smaller and line the sides in a linear pattern. One thing that is new about onshape is that instead of selecting a separate options for cutting (making holes), you instead click on extrude, and then select remove to take away material. I also learned a bunch of new keyboard shortcuts that speed up the design process. You can always find them by going to the question mark icon at the top, but some of my favorites are "n" for normal to, "d" for dimension, "c" for circle, and "z" for zoom out.

## Caster

### Base

This is a base I made for a caster in onshape. This assignment was meant to be an introduction to onshape, and to just help us grasp how to use it and how onshape is similar to solidworks. For the base, I made a rectangle, and then add seven holes to it. The first hole is bigger and it is centered around the origin, while the other six are smaller and line the sides in a linear pattern. One thing that is new about onshape is that instead of selecting a separate options for cutting (making holes), you instead click on extrude, and then select remove to take away material. I also learned a bunch of new keyboard shortcuts that speed up the design process. You can always find them by going to the question mark icon at the top, but some of my favorites are "n" for normal to, "d" for dimension, "c" for circle, and "z" for zoom out.

### Mount

The mount is the second part of the caster that we are making. I made the same part three different ways, all of which had advantages and disadvantages. The first way was doing everything in the same sketch and feature, which includes drawing the holes in the same sketch as the first square. The second way was extruding the square, and then making two more sketches for the holes. This method allows for more flexibility if you want to supress or delete elements later on. Both these methods involve linear patterns for the four corner holes, but if you need to change the dimensions of the square, your hole placement gets all messed up. An effective way of preventing this is by making a variable, and then having the edge of your square be the variable while the distance between instances of the fraction can be relative to the variable. The third way to make the mount is in the same part studio as the base. This allows you to use existing geometry to make creating the part faster.

### Fork

The fork was pretty quick to make, with one extrusion for the middle disc piece, one for the fork prongs on the bottom, and one for the tube on the top. There was also an additional cut for the hole through the prongs. This was my first time mirroring in onshape, and it was super easy and helpful. I also added chamfers and fillets along some of the edges.
